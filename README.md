# YOUR LOCAL WEATHER APP

This is a local weather web app made as an assignment at Free Code Camp. This project is part of their Front End Development Certification under Intermediate Front End Development Projects. I decided to take on all of the challenges of the assignment but take it some steps further to really showcase my skills on my portfolio.

## Requirements
1. **Objective:** Build a CodePen.io (CodePen.io is just a suggestion) app that is functionally similar to this: <http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV>.
2. **Rule #1:** Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
3. **Rule #2:** Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
4. **User Story:** I can see the weather in my current location.
5. **User Story:** I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
6. **User Story:** I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
7. **Note:** Many internet browsers now require an HTTP Secure (https://) connection to obtain a user's locale via HTML5 Geolocation. For this reason, you will need to choose one of two paths to complete this project:

Use HTML5 Geolocation to get user location and then use the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev/docs/forecast) which uses an HTTP Secure connection for the weather. Also, be sure to connect to CodePen.io via https://.

Or:

Use an Internet Protocol API to get user location (ex. [IP-API](http://ip-api.com/docs/api:json)) and then use the [OpenWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org/current#geo) for the weather. Be sure to connect to CodePen.io via http://
8. Either weather API service will require creating a free API key. Normally you want to avoid exposing API keys on CodePen, but we haven't been able to find a keyless API for weather.
9. Remember to use [Read-Search-Ask](http://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-to-get-help-when-you-are-stuck/19514) if you get stuck.
10. When you are finished, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and include a link to your CodePen.
11. You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
